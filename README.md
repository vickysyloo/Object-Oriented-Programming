# Object-Oriented-Programming

## What You Will Learn

Ruby is pure object-oriented language and everything appears to Ruby, as an object. Every value in Ruby is an object, even the most primitive things: strings, numbers and even true and false. Even a class itself is an object that is an instance of the Class class. This assignment will take you through all the major functionalities related to Object Oriented Ruby.

Develop an understanding of the following concepts:

How to start writing proper OO code in Ruby
Understanding classes, inheritance, modules, namespacing

## The Story

A squad of robotic rovers are to be landed by NASA on a plateau on Mars. This plateau, which is curiously rectangular, must be navigated by the rovers so that their on-board cameras can get a complete view of the surrounding terrain to send back to Earth.

A rover's position and location is represented by a combination of x and y co-ordinates and a letter representing one of the four cardinal compass points. The plateau is divided up into a grid to simplify navigation. An example position might be 0, 0, N, which means the rover is in the bottom left corner and facing North.
